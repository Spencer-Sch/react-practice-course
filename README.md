- Note: The video course uses react-firebase-file-uploader. I found it not to work due to changes to the Firebase api. I found a react hook uploader that I updated to use current Firebase. This is now working.

✅ Lesson 27: Uploading player images part 3 - Complete <br>

- Note: The video course uses a class based component for the fileUploader component. When creating my own customUploader component I used a functional component. This meant I needed to figure out equivalent code for my functional component to achieve the same as the instructor's class based component. I was ultimately successful.
